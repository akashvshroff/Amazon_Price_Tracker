# Outline
  * The program uses requests and BeautifulSoup in order to track an Amazon product via a user inputted url that is validated and a target price. The program also accepts a mail id that is to be mailed if the product is below target price using the python smtplib module. The program repeats the process once a day.

# Purpose
  * The program was built out of necessity as I wanted to track the price of a mechanical keyboard that I hoped to purchase once the price reached a certain level, thereby helping me produce a very useful product. While extremely engaging to code, the build allowed me to further solidify my understanding of BeautifulSoup and Web-Scraping while introducing me to automatic email via smtplib.
